/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for CineScope
 *
 * @Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data while allowing public read access to movie and series data. All write operations on user-specific data require the user to be authenticated and the request's auth UID to match the target user ID. Data structure validation is minimized to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /movies/{movieId}: Stores movie information (publicly readable).
 * - /series/{seriesId}: Stores series information (publicly readable).
 * - /users/{userId}/userPreferences/{userPreferenceId}: Stores user preferences.
 * - /users/{userId}/recommendations/{recommendationsId}: Stores movie/series recommendations for users.
 * - /users/{userId}/viewingHistory/{viewingHistoryId}: Stores user viewing history.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /movies and /series collections.
 * - Write access to /movies and /series is implicitly denied, as no rules grant it. In a production system, these collections would likely be managed by admin users.
 * - The rules prioritize authorization and relational integrity over exhaustive schema validation, to enable rapid prototyping.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   - User-specific data (UserPreferences, Recommendations, ViewingHistory) is stored under the /users/{userId} path, which makes authorization simple and efficient using the `isOwner(userId)` function.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, saturated blue (#3F51B5) for a modern, trustworthy feel. It's serious, but more lively than pure black or gray.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#1A237E) to ensure content stands out and reduce eye strain in dark environments.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight important UI elements like call-to-action buttons, selected filters, etc. It brings attention and adds a playful touch.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font for both headlines and body text due to its modern and neutral appearance which offers excellent readability across devices.
- Use flat, minimalist icons for navigation and interactive elements. Icons should be consistent in style and weight.
- Employ a card-based layout for displaying movie and series information. Use a grid system to ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations when navigating between screens and when loading new content. Use smooth scrolling and fade-in effects to enhance the user experience.
